# squiggle
a riggly line, using the vanilla HTML5 canvas

throw my mans a reference by including himmy in your sides foota near the bottom of the hteeml file yes.

```html
<script src="squiggle.js"></script>
```

now that my mans is on your page, you gotta gibe 'im a nice little divvy box

```html
<div id="squiggleContainer">
  <canvas id="squiggleCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
```

nested all nice and cozy look

but allas, we have not created a actual squiggle; for that is for the javascripty land

```javascript
var Harvey = Squiggle;
```

now, make sure to name your squiggle something nice, i have chosen the name *"Harvey"*

```javascript
Harvey.wiggle();
```

JUST LOOK AT HIM GO

WOAH.

3.2mb of pure html5 canvasy squiggly goodness; good job Harvey

```javascript
Harvey.tell({
  canvas: 'squiggleCanvas',
	height: 100,
	container: 'squiggleContainer',
	width: document.body.offsetWidth,
	frameInterval: 1
});
```

look at that lovely javascripty objectt up there; tat's the default props of Harvey, but you can customize them to your liking
